        Here is a compilation of stuff that comes across my mind in my free
        time. The lack of content here does not imply that I am busy all the
        time, instead, it shows exactly how much I procrastinate.

        Interesting stuff I found while surfing the internet. I love the content
        so much that I keep coming back to it.

        I am not a huge fan of clich√© clickbait content but Naval Ravikant is
        just too good to ignore. He might be the only rich guy who is actually
        happy.
