      <h2>Big Tech vs Startups: The myths and realities</h2>
      <p>2nd May 2022</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Should I join a startup or make myself comfortable at the Big Tech? Many
        engineers face this conundrum when applying for their first tech job or
        making a switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of this blog is to evaluate the pros and cons of working
        at different types of companies in India. This is specifically for
        engineers as I can’t speak for any other profession. Choosing a company
        type over the other is completely fine as long as it is an informed
        decision. Otherwise, you are just shooting in the dark and hoping for
        the best.
      </p>

        Why should you listen to me?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I recently switched jobs, so I have the current market data. I have
        talked to 50+ engineers in India to understand their experiences. I had
        a chat with engineers working at Amazon, Facebook, DE Shaw, JP Morgan,
        Goldman Sachs, PhonePe, smallcase, INDmoney, Jupiter, epiFi, Even,
        Bureau, and a few more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to understand the projects they were working on, the company’s
        culture, lifestyle, engineering complexities, overall morale and
        salaries. The objective was to imagine myself in their shoes and decide
        whether I want that experience for at least the next couple of years of
        my life or not.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.pageSubTitleHeader}>
        Let’s first categorise the market
      </h3>
      There are broadly two types of tech companies to work in India:
      <ol>
        <li>FAANG or the Big Tech</li>
        <li>Prominent Indian startups</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let’s go over the definitions.</p>
      <p>
        By the Big Tech, I mean any tech company that is globally recognised and
        is perceived as “prestigious” to work at. A few examples are Google,
        Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Zomato, Goldman Sachs, Byju’s, etc. Any
        company that you think is “too big” will fall into this category. These
        companies have built a lot of processes, and you need to use these
        internal processes and systems to push new features. They have almost
        all the theoretical software engineering principles, that you have read,
        in place for improving code quality and productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Indian startup ecosystem has been booming for the past few years. A
        lot of young tech startups are emerging, and all of them are loaded with
        cash. A few examples are CRED, BlinkIt, PhonePe and smallcase. They are
        disrupting one industry after the other, and are always looking to hire
        fresh talent. These companies are a great place to work at. They are
        fast-moving and disruptive but also organised enough to have a few
        engineering processes in place.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.pageSubTitleHeader}>Less than ideal options</h3>
      <p>
        There are two more categories of companies that I have left out of my
        argument: early-stage startups and the “average” companies. The average
        companies are well heard of but are not especially famous for their
        engineering talent. A few examples are Infosys, Accenture, and Dell.
        There is nothing wrong with working at such companies, but there is
        nothing special about them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early-stage startups are risky. There are only two scenarios in which
        it’s a good idea to join an early-stage startup:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You personally know the founder (or the CEO), and their past
          experiences are proof of their exceptional execution skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          You feel inspired by the technical co-founder (or the CTO) and their
          vast achievements. They must have a record of technical competence in
          the past.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the co-founders of the early-stage startup you are planning to join
        do not meet these criteria then you might be taking a casual risk by
        joining the company. I am not saying that the startup is destined to
        fail; there are a lot of factors that come into play to determine the
        success or failure of a company. Also, there is a huge factor of luck.
        But, I think it makes a lot more sense to take a calculated risk as
        opposed to a casual one. If a calculated risk doesn’t work out then you
        will be able to precisely measure the fault in your risk evaluation.
        But, you will not learn anything from the failure or, even the success,
        of a casual risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, you should ideally go for the Big Tech or prominent Indian
        startups. Going for the average company doesn't make sense. Going to
        early-stage startups is a personal choice that will need more data to
        make an informed decision.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.pageSubTitleHeader}>
        The myths and realities of working at the Big tech
      </h3>
      <p>
        Working at Google proves you are one of the smartest engineers in the
        country, Yeah, that’s a myth. There are a lot of smart folks working
        outside the Google premises. Joining FAANG only proved that you are good
        at solving algorithmic problems and designing systems on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The harsh reality of working at the Big Tech is that you are
        insignificant. They can easily replace you with any of the 5000
        applicants in their inboxes. You only get to work on a small chunk of a
        huge problem. You don’t get to work on as exciting projects as you
        thought when you were applying. The good news is that this is only true
        till you don’t have enough experience to hold managerial positions at
        the company. By the time you have 5-6 years of experience, you will have
        the power to make key decisions. Senior engineers also get to work on
        exciting projects that the company truly cares about, which makes them
        irreplaceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big Tech pays well but so do the startups. The perks of working at the
        likes of Google are more than just money. You get social validation.
        It’s like a certificate that you can show to anyone proving that you are
        a “talented” engineer. It will be easier for you to switch jobs because
        recruiters will approach you as opposed to the other way around. It will
        be easier to raise venture capital for your own startup because you can
        validate your technical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have relevant experience to join in a more senior position then
        the Big Tech is a solid choice. Otherwise, if you are not ready to
        compromise your absolute learning and self-worth then you might want to
        stay away from the Big Tech for a while.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.pageSubTitleHeader}>
        The myths and realities of working at a startup
      </h3>
      <p>
        Aah… the cool ones. Startup engineers have all figured it out. They work
        for a crazy number of hours to build a piece of tech that will change
        the way we see the world. They will retire at the age of 26 with all the
        stocks they got from the company. Again, a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t know which startup will succeed in the long run. Even venture
        capitalists can’t accurately predict that, and it’s literally their
        full-time job. You don’t always work on super exciting stuff; mundane
        boring tasks are also part of the job. You might end up without a job
        after just a year, or worse, you might end up giving up 4 years of your
        life for worthless stock options because the company never went public.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, one thing is certain, you will work on crazy projects with
        brilliant folks. Remember, I am not talking about early-stage ventures.
        By startups, I mean companies that have raised at least a Series-A or
        Series-B funding round. These companies have proved that the market and
        the demand exist. They are now probably trying to find a product-market
        fit. You will get to solve complex engineering problems because startups
        are constantly scaling their systems and pushing for new features. You
        will work with brilliant folks because building these complex systems
        and processes is no joke. A startup needs a pool of talented engineers
        to function otherwise it’s destined to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, if you want to boost your learning experience by still earning as
        much as the Big Tech then prominent startups might be your best option.
        Although, you will have to give up on social status. You will not be
        respected as much as a Google or Apple engineer. So, be ready for that
        as well.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.pageSubTitleHeader}>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Joining any company is a risk. You don’t know what is going to happen to
        the company or yourself in the next couple of years. The least you could
        do is take a calculated risk instead of shooting in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would again like to clarify that there is nothing wrong with choosing
        the Big Tech over startups, or vice-versa. It’s a matter of personal
        preference. I know a couple of talented engineers working at Amazon and
        Citadel who have achieved a lot in their careers. They have worked on
        the technology that you and I haven’t even heard of. On the other hand,
        I have also met a few engineers working at unheard-of startups building
        systems that are just too complex to explain in this blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing wrong with taking calculated risks, even if it ends up
        upsetting a few people.
      </p>
      <p>Stay humble and dream big!</p>
